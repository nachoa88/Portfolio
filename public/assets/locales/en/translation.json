    "idea-title": "How did the idea come about?",
    "idea-konecta-1": "K0N3CT4 arises as a result of the final group project for the Web Development course that I completed in November 2023. It was developed by me and 3 other people, the general idea of the project came from the slogan proposed by our teacher: How to relate teenagers and culture?",
    "idea-konecta-2": "This question has led us to think about different ways to bring culture closer to teenagers, taking into account their needs and restrictions. This is why we decided to create a specific application for them, which is practical and simple, and where they can find “underground” cultural events that are free.",
    "idea-konecta-3": "The project will collect information about these cultural events and display them in two formats, a list with all the details (description, type of event, time and place) and also on a map.",
    "idea-konecta-4": "Both the list and the map allow users to filter the content to quickly find the type of event that suits their needs. These filters can be customized when creating a user by completing the interest fields.",
    "idea-konecta-5": "At the same time, users will be able to interact with each other, see the events their friends are attending and unlock rewards for participating in the community, commenting and rating the events they have attended.",
    
    "how-title": "How was the project carried out?",
    "how-konecta-1": "Regarding the development process, the first thing we have done was make a LO-FI sketch in Figma, both mobile and desktop, which has then been improved, adding color and style.",
    "how-konecta-2": "On the other hand, we used Trello to manage our workflow and distribute tasks, and GitHub to help us manage, track and control changes while developing the application.",
    "front-konecta-text": "Made in React, using the Router library to manage traffic from one page to the other, and JavaScript as the main language for functions and components. For the style, both CSS and Bootrsap have been used, and to improve responsiveness, Media Queries. We have also placed great emphasis on making the application accessible to all types of users, with an average accessibility of 98%. To deploy it, we have moved the project build to an Amazon Web Services EC2 instance.",
    "back-konecta-text": "We have used Spring Boot for our API, and where we have created our controllers, entities and repositories. Once its functionality has been created and tested, as well as the front-end, we have moved it to an AWS EC2 instance using Apache Tomcat in .war format.",
    "data-base": "Data Base",
    "db-konecta-text": "The database was first created in .json format and then moved to an RDS on Amazon Web Services. It is displayed in the application using a “fetch” and is responsible for showing us all the information about each event.",
